### Welcome to Regenix
#### A solution to complicated sustainable living in different countries

**
I am working on this project with 2 german students from our India Gateway Project - Germany 2025 programme.
The UI of this app may not be upto standard due to the time constraint and the fact that we are working on this project remotely.
**

Create a ```.env`` in the root of your project and add your API keys to the following variables:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API=<get-this-token-from-[here](https://www.weatherapi.com/my/)>
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ID=<appwrite-project-id>
EXPO_PUBLIC_AQI_API=<get-this-token-from-[here](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/)>
EXPO_PUBLIC_NLP_API=<hugging-face-token>
EXPO_PUBLIC_STORAGE_ID=<appwrite-bucket-id>
EXPO_PUBLIC_DATABASE_ID=<appwrite-database-id>
```

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
